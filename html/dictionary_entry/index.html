    My questions: 
1. If I'm not using input do I need to create labels for each element?

2. For element <p> is the appropriate use done so in this file? If not,
    how else would/should I have used the paragraph element?

3. Can I combine elements with a <br> to reduce redundancy or would 
    that be considered bad coding practices?

4. Should each element have an id?

5. Is it better coding practice and safer for cybersecurity to have the images
    stored on computer? And if so, how would I block potential hackers from accesses files
    by loading images from my computer? 


6. Piggy backing on question 3, could I make part of my code in HTML private elements like 
    within Java/Python to limit access to outsiders?
