**The fix_indentation is code copied and intended for
the student to demonstrate knowledge on PCS relationships via indentation.**


**Please note: **
1. Utilize index.html file.
2. Code to correct begins at lines 1 thru 16 for index1.html and 1 thru 34 on index2.html. 
3. My corrections - Melissa Curylo - begin at line 18 thru 29 on index1.html and 39 thru 72 on index2.html. 
4. Indentation via the 'tab' button on keyboard.
5. One tab entry is one indentation. 
6. Happy learning, Strenght through struggle!


**Indentation via tab examples **
Hit tab once = one indentation
Hit tab twice = two indentations

    Tab once placement
        Tab twice placement
            Tab three times placement


*PCS = Parent, Child, Sibling *

*Parent *
No indentations
<html> = also known as the root element, everything is a descendent of <html>

*Child * 
One indentation - I consider these tier 1 children
<head> = first child of <html> 
<body> = second or last child of <html>

Two indentations - Secondary tier children
<title> = child of <head>
<h1> = child of <body>
<p> = child of <body>



**Siblings **
<head> = sibling to <body>
<body> = sibling to <head>
<h1> = sibling to <p>
<p> = sibling to <h1>



General Format:
<html>
    <head> 
        <title>
    <body>
        <h1>
        <p>
