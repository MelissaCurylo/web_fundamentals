Questions
1. How would I use select tags with links and then once a user makes selection said user is redirected to selected link
    via new window while portfolio page remains open?
        Code I was trying to implement:
            <select name="stacks" id="selectRedirect" onchange="this.options[this.selectedIndex].value">
                <option value="Stacks">Select a stack</option>
                <option value="https://github.com/MelissaCurylo/webFundamentals_AllProjects">HTML, CSS, Javascript</option>
